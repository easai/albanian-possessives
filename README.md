# Albanian Possessive Pronoun Explorer

An interactive web application for exploring Albanian possessive pronouns across four grammatical dimensions:

- **Person of the possessor** (e.g. 1s, 2p, 3s(f))
- **Gender of the possessor** (masculine, feminine)
- **Number of the possessed noun** (singular, plural)
- **Gender of the possessed noun** (masculine, feminine)
- **Grammatical case** (nominative, accusative, dative)

Built with **Alpine.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and optionally extendable with **Chart.js** or **3D cube simulations**, this project lets users navigate the full paradigm interactively.


## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Use the dropdowns to select the **gender** and **number** of the possessed noun.
3. View the pronoun forms for each grammatical person across **nominative**, **accusative**, and **dative** cases.
4. Extend with Cube or Chart.js visualization if desired.


## Linguistic Note

Albanian possessive pronouns reflect agreement both with the **possessor** and the **possessed noun** in gender, number, and case. Dative forms often shift morphologically via “të”, “së”, or stem variation depending on the paradigm quadrant.

This tool is intended to provide both native speakers and learners with a structured, visual reference to aid understanding of Albanian grammar.
